This is Kasey's data science research project for the Coding School Summer Research Program 2022.

Here are some potential research questions: 
How can we predict the type of bicycle a person is using by looking at the different variables given in the Citibike dataset?
What are the differences in distance and ride time regarding electric or classic bikes?
Do members and casual Citibike users have differences in ride time, distance, and starting or ending locations?
